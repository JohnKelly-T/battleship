# ðŸ›¥ Battleship
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic board game Battleship, built as part of  [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. You'll strategically place your ships on the board and then take turns firing at an AI opponent, aiming to sink all their ships before they sink yours.

## Features
- Player vs. Computer AI: Play against an intelligent computer opponent.
- Ship Placement: Manually place your ships on the board at the start of the game.
- Interactive Gameplay: Clickable game boards for firing shots.
- Game audio: Immersive experience with sounds on every hit.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the game.
- CSS3: For styling and layout, including responsive design.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For game logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive elements.
- Webpack: For bundling JavaScript modules.
- Jest: For testing JavaScript code.

## Core Skills Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing and implementing game entities (e.g., Gameboard, Ship, Player) using OOP principles.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing the actual code to ensure functionality and robustness.
- DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updating the user interface based on game state.
- Game Logic Implementation: Developing the core rules and flow of the Battleship game.
- User Interface (UI) Development: Creating an intuitive and engaging user experience.
